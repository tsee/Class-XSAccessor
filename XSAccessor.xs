 * Quoting chocolateboy from his Method::Lexical module at 2009-02-08:
 *
 * for binary compatibility (see perlapi.h), XS modules perform a function call to
 * access each and every interpreter variable. So, for instance, an innocuous-looking
 * reference to PL_op becomes:
 *
 *     (*Perl_Iop_ptr(my_perl))
 *
 * This (obviously) impacts performance. Internally, PL_op is accessed as:
 *
 *     my_perl->Iop
 *
 * (in threaded/multiplicity builds (see intrpvar.h)), which is significantly faster.
 *
 * defining PERL_CORE gets us the fast version, at the expense of a future maintenance release
 * possibly breaking things: https://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl5.porters/browse_thread/thread/9ec0da3f02b3b5a
 *
 * Rather than globally defining PERL_CORE, which pokes its fingers into various headers, exposing
 * internals we'd rather not see, just define it for XSUB.h, which includes
 * perlapi.h, which imposes the speed limit.

 * chocolateboy: 2009-09-06 - 2009-11-14:
 *
 * entersub OPs that call our accessors are optimized (i.e. replaced with optimized versions)
 * in versions of perl >= 5.10.0. This section describes the implementation.
 *
 * TL;DR: the first time one of our fast (XS) accessors is called, we reach up into the
 * calling OP (OP_ENTERSUB) and change its implementation (PL_op->op_ppaddr) to an optimized
 * version that takes advantage of the fact that our accessors are straightforward hash/array lookups.
 * In order for this to work safely, we need to be able to disable/prevent this optimization
 * in some circumstances. This is done by setting a "don't optimize me" flag on the entersub OP.
 * Prior to 5.10.0, there were no spare bits available on entersub OPs we could use for this, but
 * perls >= 5.10.0 have a new OP member called op_spare that gives us 3 whole bits to play with!
 *
 * First, some preliminaries: a method call is performed as a subroutine call at the OP
 * level. There's some additional work to look up the method CV and push the invocant
 * on the stack, but the current OP inside a method call is the subroutine call OP, OP_ENTERSUB.
 *
 * Two distinct invocations of the same method will have two entersub OPs and will receive
 * the same CV on the stack:
 *
 *     $foo->bar(...); # OP 1: CV 1
 *     $foo->bar(...); # OP 2: CV 1
 *
 * There are also situations in which the same entersub OP calls more than one CV:
 *
 *     $foo->$_() for ('foo', 'bar'); # OP 1: CV 1, CV 2
 *
 * Inside each Class::XSAccessor XSUB, we can access the current entersub OP (PL_op).
 * The default entersub implementation (pp_entersub in pp_hot.c) has a lot of boilerplate for
 * dealing with all the different ways in which subroutines can be called. It sets up
 * and tears down a new scope; it deals with the fact that the code ref can be passed
 * in as a GV or CV; and it has numerous conditional statements to deal with the various
 * different types of CV.
 *
 * For our XSUB accessors, we don't need most of that. We don't need to open a new scope;
 * the subroutine is almost always a CV (that's what OP_METHOD and OP_METHOD_NAMED usually return);
 * and we don't need to deal with all the non-XSUB cases. This allows us to replace the
 * OP's implementation (op_ppaddr) with a version optimized for our simple XSUBs. (This
 * is inspired by B::XSUB::Dumber: nothingmuch++)
 *
 * We do this inside the accessor i.e. at runtime. We can also back out the optimization
 * if a call site proves to be dynamic e.g. if a method is redefined or the method is
 * called with multiple different CVs (see below).
 *
 * In practice, this is rarely the case. the vast majority of method calls in perl,
 * and in most dynamic languages (cf. Google's v8), behave like method calls in static
 * languages. for instance, 97% of the call sites exercised by perl 5.10.0's test suite are
 * monomorphic.
 *
 * We only replace the op_ppaddr pointer of entersub OPs that use the default pp_entersub.
 * this ensures we don't interfere with any modules that assign a new op_ppaddr e.g.
 * Data::Alias, Faster. it also ensures we don't tread on our own toes and repeatedly
 * re-assign the same optimized entersub.
 *
 * There's one optimized entersub for each type of Class::XSAccessor accessor. To save typing,
 * they're generated by C preprocessor macros i.e. poor man's generic programming.
 *
 * If, for some reason, the entersub should not be optimized, a flag is set on the
 * entersub OP. This flag is detected inside the accessor. If the flag is set,
 * the accessor will never try to optimize the entersub OP.
 *
 * There are a number of situations in which optimization is disabled.
 *
 * 1) if the entersub is not perl's default entersub i.e. if another module has
 * provided its own entersub implementation, then we don't replace it.
 *
 * 2) if the call site is dynamic. the optimized entersub is optimized for a particular
 * type of Class::XSAccessor accessor (e.g. getter, setter, predicate &c.). if
 * an optimized entersub finds itself invoking a function other than the
 * specific XSUB it's tailored for, then the entersub optimization is disabled.
 * This also applies if a method is redefined so that an optimized
 * entersub is passed a different type of CV than the one it's optimized for.
 *
 * 1) is detected inside the accessor. 2) is detected inside the optimized entersub.
 * In the second case, we reinstate the previous entersub, which by 1) was perl's pp_entersub.
 *
 * Note: Class::XSAccessor XSUBs continue to optimize "new" call sites, regardless of what may
 * have happened to a "previous" OP or what may happen to a "subsequent" OP. Take the following
 * example:
 *
 *     1: package Example;
 *     2:
 *     3: use Class::XSAccessor { getters => 'foo' };
 *     4:
 *     5: for (1 .. 10) {
 *     6:     $self->foo();
 *     7:     $self->$_ for ('foo', 'bar');
 *     8:     $self->foo();
 *     9: }
 *
 * Here, line 6 is optimized as normal. Line 7 is optimized on the first call, when $_ is "foo",
 * but the optimization is disabled on the second call, when $_ is "bar", because &Example::bar
 * is not a Class::XSAccessor getter. All subsequent calls on line 7, use perl's default entersub.
 * Line 8 is optimized as normal. i.e. the disabled optimization on line 7 doesn't affect subsequent
 * optimizations. On line 7, only the entersub OP is "pessimized". &Example::foo continues to "look for"
 * "new" entersub OPs to optimize. Indeed, any calls to &Example::foo will get the optimization treatment,
 * even call sites outside the Example package/file.
 *
 * The following CXAA_OPTIMIZE_ENTERSUB* (Array) and CXAH_OPTIMIZE_ENTERSUB* (Hash) macros are
 * called from within our accessors to install the optimized entersub (if possible).
 * The CXAA_GENERATE_ENTERSUB* and CXAH_GENERATE_ENTERSUB* macros further down
 * generate optimized entersubs for the accessors defined in XS/Array.xs and XS/Hash.xs.
