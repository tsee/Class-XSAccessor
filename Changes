Revision history for Perl extension Class-XSAccessor.

1.09  Sun Oct 31 12:45 2010
  - Fix #62531: Predicates return value, not bool (SJOHNSTON)
  - TODO test for perl-crashing bug (in perl) that can happen
    on (arcane) XSUB aliasing on perl's < 5.8.9 (Peter Rabbitson)
    We're open for work-around patches.

1.08  Fri Sep 17 20:30 2010
  - Promote latest development release to a stable release.

1.07_04  Sun Sep 12 10:30 2010
  - Since WIN32 doesn't have the PERL_CORE optimization,
    it gets the PERL_NO_GET_CONTEXT optimization back.
  - Add threading test that would previously crash on win32
    and perls compiled with track-mempool.
  - Use the system's malloc/etc for the shared memory, not perl's.

1.07_03  Thu Sep  9 20:30 2010
  - Minor constructor optimization/cleanup.
  - Various built-time warning fixes.
  - PERL_CORE optimization now disabled on WIN32.
  - Class::Accessor::Fast compatibility code added (not
    for public consumption!)
  - Clear requirement of Perl 5.8 everywhere.
  - Fix minor (constant as in O(1)) memory leak.

1.07_02  Mon Aug 23 20:30 2010
  - Various warning fixes and small cleanups over previous
    dev. version.

1.07_01  Wed Aug 18 20:30 2010
  - Experimental support for lvalue accessors:
    $obj->foo = 12

1.07  Sun Aug 15 14:41 2010
  - Include two new test files for the fix in 1.06.
  - Define PERL_CORE, but *only* while including XSUB.h to get
    a significant speed-up (see XSAccessor.xs for an explanation).
    Idea from chocolateboy. Complaints from rightfully annoyed
    perl5-porters (in particular but not limited to Nicholas)
    go to Steffen.

1.06  Sat Aug 14 20:21 2010
  - Add sanity checks to make sure we don't segfault on
    invalid invocants (chocolateboy)

  - Minor developer doc tweaks.
  - Minor XS refactoring

1.04_05  Mon Nov  9 20:10 2009
  - Fixes for perls < 5.10:
    => No entersub optimization
    => Do no use precalculated hashes
  - Updated entersub optimization
  - Remove brain-damaged double-hashing
  - Minor portability fixlets

1.04_04  Thu Nov  5 18:00 2009
  - Fixes for non-threaded perls
    (no need for locks, perl_mutex not even defined).

1.04_03  Tue Nov  3 22:32 2009
  ** This release features some very radical changes. Test well. **
  - Replace use of perl hashes in the global hash key name storage with
    a full-blown, separate implementation of a hash table
    (Steffen, chocolateboy)
  - Similarly, throw out the SV's for simple C strings.
  - Add a global lock for all modifications to global data structures:
  - The above three items fix RT #50454 (serious threading issues).
  - Add support for alternate use Class::XSAccessor { ... } syntax
    (Adam K)

1.04_02  Mon Sep  7 11:35 2009
  ** This release features some very radical changes. Test well. **

  ** This release features some very radical changes. Test well. **
  - More aggressive OPTIMIZE flags if possible (chocolateboy)

    where the attribute has the same name as the method (chocolateboy)

  - Refactored the XS to remove duplicate code.
  - Refactored the perl code in XSAccessor.pm and Array.pm to remove
    duplicate code (=> Heavy.pm).
