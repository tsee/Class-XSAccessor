# The purpose of this test is to check the thread-safety of the module.
# Since this kind of stuff is highly non-deterministic, it's hard to construct
# tests that are. The test consists of running several threads in parallel,
# which all try the two main aspects of the module in a tight loop:
# - creating methods
# - calling those methods
# The former is the type of operation that writes to thread-shared memory
# and requires locking. The latter should not pose any threat to thread-safety
# apart from the OP-tree-inlining optimization.
# Given a certain number of operations per thread, we randomly choose a fraction
# of method creations and method calls to make sure that there's some overlap of
# both types of operations among all test threads.
# The 'common' method below is special cased to ensure that there's some method
# overwriting going on that likely affects multiple threads trying to modify or
# read-access the thread-global memory at the same time in the
# most-likely-colliding manner. The writing-to-shared-memory situation is very
# likely to cause this to crash if the locking isn't working since the memory
# is re-allocated with a geometric-growth algorithm.
# PS: I suspect the whole locking thing is broken on cygwin and thus this test
#     consistently fails there.
